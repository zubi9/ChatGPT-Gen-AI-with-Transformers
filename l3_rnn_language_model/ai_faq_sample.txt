What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)? AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning, reasoning, and self-correction.
What are the types of AI?AI can be categorized into two types: Narrow AI (Weak AI) and General AI (Strong AI). Narrow AI is designed for a specific task, while General AI aims to perform any intellectual task that a human can do.
What are some examples of Narrow AI?Examples of Narrow AI include virtual personal assistants like Siri and Alexa, recommendation systems like those used by Netflix and Amazon, and autonomous vehicles.
What is Machine Learning?Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables machines to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.
How does Deep Learning differ from Machine Learning?Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning that deals with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain's neural networks. It involves learning from large amounts of data, often unstructured or unlabeled.
What are some real-world applications of AI?AI is used in various fields, including healthcare (diagnosis and treatment recommendations), finance (fraud detection and algorithmic trading), retail (personalized shopping experiences), and entertainment (content recommendation).
